ðŸ”§ BUILD ERROR FIXED - Missing tsconfig.node.json

ERROR:
[vite:esbuild] parsing /vercel/path0/tsconfig.node.json failed: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory

SOLUTION:
âœ… Added missing tsconfig.node.json file to DEPLOY-TO-GITHUB package
âœ… File contains proper TypeScript configuration for Vite build process

FIXED FILES IN DEPLOY-TO-GITHUB PACKAGE:
- tsconfig.node.json (ADDED - was missing)
- tsconfig.json (already present)
- All other configuration files complete

UPLOAD TO GITHUB:
Copy ALL files from DEPLOY-TO-GITHUB folder to your GitHub repository
Vercel will now build successfully without the missing file error

The build will complete and your site will deploy with:
- Fixed specialized services section
- Complete styling restored
- Professional design working properly
