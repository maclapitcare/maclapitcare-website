ðŸš€ MANUAL UPLOAD SOLUTION - Since Download Isn't Working

STEP-BY-STEP MANUAL PROCESS:

1. OPEN YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY in browser
2. DELETE ALL EXISTING FILES from your repository
3. MANUALLY UPLOAD FILES from DEPLOY-TO-GITHUB folder:

REQUIRED FILES TO UPLOAD (copy from DEPLOY-TO-GITHUB folder):
âœ… package.json (includes Typography plugin - CRITICAL)
âœ… tailwind.config.ts (fixed configuration - CRITICAL) 
âœ… index.html
âœ… vite.config.ts
âœ… vercel.json
âœ… tsconfig.json
âœ… postcss.config.js
âœ… .gitignore
âœ… README.md
âœ… src/ folder (entire folder with all contents)
âœ… public/ folder (entire folder with all contents)

GITHUB UPLOAD METHOD:
- Click "Add file" â†’ "Upload files" 
- Drag files from DEPLOY-TO-GITHUB folder
- Or use "Create new file" and copy-paste content from each file

KEY FILES THAT FIX STYLING:
- package.json: Contains "@tailwindcss/typography": "^0.5.15" 
- tailwind.config.ts: Contains plugins: [require("tailwindcss-animate"), require("@tailwindcss/typography")]
- src/index.css: Fixed CSS base layer

After upload, Vercel will auto-deploy with proper styling restored!
