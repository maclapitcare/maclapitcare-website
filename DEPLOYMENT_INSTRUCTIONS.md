# CRITICAL: Vercel Deployment Fix

## Problem Identified:
Vercel is still trying to use old build command: `cd client && npm install`
But the new clean structure has everything in the root directory.

## Fixed Configuration:
Updated `vercel.json` with correct settings:
- buildCommand: "npm run build" 
- outputDirectory: "dist"
- installCommand: "npm install"
- framework: "vite"

## Deployment Steps:

### Method 1: Update Existing Vercel Project
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click "Settings" → "General" 
3. Update build settings:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install`
4. Click "Save"
5. Go to "Deployments" → "Redeploy"

### Method 2: Delete and Recreate Project
1. Delete current Vercel project
2. Create new project from GitHub
3. When configuring:
   - Framework: "Vite"
   - Leave all fields empty (use defaults)
4. Deploy

## Expected Build Log:
```
Running "install" command: `npm install`...
Running "build" command: `npm run build`...
> vite build
Build completed successfully
```

## Verification:
Upload the updated `maclapitcare-vercel-clean` folder to GitHub first, then redeploy.
The vercel.json now has the correct build configuration.
