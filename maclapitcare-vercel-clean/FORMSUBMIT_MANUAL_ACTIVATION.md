# FormSubmit.co Manual Activation Guide

## Issue Identified:
The activation link is invalid because FormSubmit.co requires fresh activation for the new Vercel domain.

## Solution: Manual Form Activation

### Step 1: Test Form Submission (Triggers New Activation)
1. Go to your live website: `https://maclapitcare-website-dikqo3hba-maclapitcare.vercel.app/`
2. Fill out and submit any contact form on the homepage
3. This will trigger FormSubmit.co to send a fresh activation email

### Step 2: Check Your Email
After submitting the form, check your email at `maclapitcare@gmail.com` for:
- New activation email from FormSubmit.co
- Fresh activation link specific to the Vercel domain

### Step 3: Activate
Click the new activation link to enable unlimited form submissions.

## Current Form Configuration:
All forms are configured to send to: `maclapitcare@gmail.com`
- Contact forms on all pages
- Service booking modals
- Location-specific inquiry forms
- Device repair request forms

## Why This Happens:
FormSubmit.co generates activation tokens based on:
1. Email address
2. Sending domain (your website URL)
3. Form configuration

Since your website moved to a new Vercel domain, a fresh activation is required.

## Expected Result:
After activation, you'll receive:
- Professional email notifications for all form submissions
- Unlimited monthly submissions
- Proper AJAX responses on your website
- No monthly limits (unlike other services)

## Backup Plan:
If forms don't work immediately, you can also use alternative contact methods displayed on your website:
- Phone: 9211720790
- WhatsApp integration (already working)
- Direct email contact information
