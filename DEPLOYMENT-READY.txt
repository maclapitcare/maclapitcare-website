âœ… COMPLETE STYLING FIX - READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

FILES CREATED IN YOUR REPLIT:
- DEPLOY-TO-GITHUB/ (folder with all fixed files)
- DEPLOY-TO-GITHUB.zip (compressed version)

ALTERNATIVE METHOD - MANUAL COPY:
If download still fails, manually copy files from DEPLOY-TO-GITHUB folder:

1. Open the DEPLOY-TO-GITHUB folder in Replit
2. Copy all files one by one to your GitHub repository
3. Or use GitHub's web editor to paste file contents

KEY FILES TO COPY:
- package.json (includes Typography plugin)
- tailwind.config.ts (fixed configuration)
- src/index.css (corrected base layer)
- All files in src/ folder

WHAT THIS FIXES:
- Adds @tailwindcss/typography plugin for professional text styling
- Fixes Tailwind configuration that was breaking styles
- Includes all UI components for proper button/card/form styling
- Restores professional blue gradient design

The folder is now visible in your left sidebar file tree.
