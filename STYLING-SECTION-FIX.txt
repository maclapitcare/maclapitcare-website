ðŸ”§ SPECIALIZED REPAIR SERVICES SECTION - FIXED

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
The "Specialized Repair Services" section was showing simple icons instead of detailed service cards because:
- Homepage was using ServicesSection (simplified icons)
- Should also include ServicesOverview (detailed service cards)

âœ… SOLUTION APPLIED TO DEPLOY-TO-GITHUB PACKAGE:

Fixed DEPLOY-TO-GITHUB/src/pages/home.tsx:
- Added import for ServicesOverview component
- Added <ServicesOverview /> to homepage render
- Now shows BOTH sections:
  1. Main services (ServicesSection) - with device cards
  2. Detailed repair services (ServicesOverview) - with pricing and features

RESULT AFTER GITHUB UPLOAD:
Instead of simple icons showing:
- Logic Board Repair (icon only)
- Data Recovery (icon only)  
- Speaker Repair (icon only)
- Cooling System (icon only)

Will now show detailed service cards with:
- Full descriptions
- Feature lists with checkmarks
- Pricing (Starting â‚¹2,999, etc.)
- "Get Quote" buttons
- Professional styling with gray cards and blue buttons

The specialized services section will now display the rich, detailed cards with proper styling instead of basic icon placeholders.
