# GitHub Repository Cleanup Solution

## Problem
The build is still failing with `cd: client: No such file or directory` because your GitHub repository contains old build configuration that references the client folder.

## Root Cause
Your GitHub repository still has old files that contain build commands like:
```
"cd client && npm install"
```

But the MAIN-PROJECT-DEPLOY package doesn't use a client folder structure.

## Complete Solution

### Step 1: Clean GitHub Repository
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. **DELETE EVERY SINGLE FILE** - don't leave anything
3. Make sure the repository is completely empty

### Step 2: Upload MAIN-PROJECT-DEPLOY
1. Open the `MAIN-PROJECT-DEPLOY` folder in Replit
2. **Download ALL files** from this folder:
   - package.json (with correct build scripts)
   - src/ folder (all components)
   - public/ folder (assets)
   - index.html
   - vite.config.ts
   - tailwind.config.ts
   - vercel.json (correct configuration)
   - All other config files

### Step 3: Verify Upload
Make sure your GitHub repository structure looks like:
```
maclapitcare-website/
├── src/
├── public/
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── vite.config.ts
└── vercel.json
```

NOT like:
```
maclapitcare-website/
├── client/  ← This should NOT exist
├── server/  ← This should NOT exist
```

## The Issue
Vercel is reading old configuration files that expect a `client` folder, but the new structure doesn't have one.

Complete cleanup and fresh upload will resolve this.
