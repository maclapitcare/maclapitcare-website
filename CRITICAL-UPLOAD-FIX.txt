🚨 CRITICAL: Old Build Configuration Still in GitHub

PROBLEM:
Vercel error: "cd: client: No such file or directory" 
This means your GitHub repository still has OLD files with client folder references.

SOLUTION - Complete Repository Reset:

1. 🗑️ DELETE EVERYTHING from GitHub Repository
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Delete ALL files (leave repository completely empty)
   - Don't leave any old configuration files

2. 📦 Upload MAIN-PROJECT-DEPLOY Package
   - This folder contains the working Replit code
   - Upload ALL files from MAIN-PROJECT-DEPLOY folder
   - Ensure correct package.json with "vite build" command

3. ✅ Verify Repository Structure:
   Should look like:
   ```
   your-repo/
   ├── src/           ← React components
   ├── public/        ← Assets  
   ├── package.json   ← "build": "vite build"
   ├── vercel.json    ← Correct Vercel config
   └── config files
   ```

   Should NOT have:
   - client/ folder
   - server/ folder  
   - Any files referencing "cd client"

The issue is old configuration files are still in your GitHub repo. Complete replacement will fix this.
