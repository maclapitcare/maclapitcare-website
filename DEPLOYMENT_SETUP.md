# ðŸš€ MacLap IT Care - Complete Deployment Setup Guide

## FormSubmit.co Email Configuration

### Step 1: Update Email Addresses
The forms are currently configured to send emails to `maclapitcare@gmail.com`. Update these in:

**Files to modify:**
- `client/src/components/forms/formsubmit-contact-form.tsx` (line 22)
- `client/src/components/forms/formsubmit-service-form.tsx` (line 22)

Replace with your actual business email address.

### Step 2: Activate FormSubmit Forms
1. **Deploy to Vercel** first (instructions below)
2. **Visit your live website** and submit each form once:
   - Go to Contact page and submit the contact form
   - Go to any service page and submit the service form
3. **Check your email** for FormSubmit confirmation emails
4. **Click activation links** in both emails
5. **Forms are now active** and will receive unlimited submissions

## Vercel Deployment Instructions

### Method 1: GitHub Integration (Recommended)
1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "FormSubmit integration - unlimited forms"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Vercel:**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect the settings
   - Click "Deploy"

### Method 2: Direct Upload
1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Upload dist/public folder** to Vercel manually

## Vercel Configuration

The `vercel.json` is configured for static deployment:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "dist/public" }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Post-Deployment Setup

### 1. Custom Domain (Optional)
- Add `maclapitcare.com` in Vercel dashboard
- Update DNS records as instructed

### 2. Form Testing
After deployment, test both forms:
- Contact form: Sends general inquiries
- Service form: Sends detailed service requests

### 3. Email Management
FormSubmit will send emails with this format:
- **Subject:** "New Contact Form Submission - MacLap IT Care"
- **From:** FormSubmit service
- **Content:** All form fields formatted clearly
